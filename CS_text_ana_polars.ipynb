Intent Prediction Models (Easy → Complex)\\nBaseline Models (Easy)\\n\\n\\n\\nTF-IDF + Logistic Regression / SVM\\n\\n\\n\\nVectorize text (instruction or response) using TF-IDF.\\nTrain a simple classifier (Logistic Regression or SVM) to predict intent.\\nPros: Easy to implement, interpretable.\\nCons: Ignores word order and context.\\n\\n\\n\\nTF-IDF + Random Forest / XGBoost\\n\\n\\n\\nHandles non-linearity better than LR/SVM but may overfit without tuning.\\nIntermediate Models\\nWord Embeddings (FastText, GloVe) + ML\\n\\n\\n\\nUse pre-trained embeddings to represent text as dense vectors (average or max pooling).\\nTrain a classifier (e.g., XGBoost) on top.\\nPros: Captures semantic meaning better than TF-IDF.\\nSimple Neural Networks (e.g., MLP)\\n\\n\\n\\nFeed word embeddings into a shallow neural network.\\nExample architecture:\\nEmbedding Layer → Flatten → Dense → Softmax\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvanced Models (Complex)\\nDeep Learning with RNNs/LSTMs\\n\\n\\n\\nModel sequential context using LSTM/GRU:\\nEmbedding → LSTM → Dense → Softmax\\n\\n\\n\\nPros: Captures word order and long-range dependencies.\\nTransformer-Based Models (BERT, DistilBERT, etc.)\\n\\n\\n\\nFine-tune a pre-trained transformer (e.g., BERT) on your dataset.\\nSteps:\\nTokenize text.\\nFeed into BERT, use [CLS] token for classification.\\nAdd a dense layer on top for intent prediction.\\nPros: State-of-the-art performance, understands context deeply.\\nCons: Computationally expensive.\\n3. Additional Enhancements\\nMulti-Task Learning: Predict intent and category simultaneously.\\nData Augmentation: If data is sparse, use back-translation or synonym replacement.\\nEnsemble Models: Combine predictions from TF-IDF + BERT for robustness.\\n4.
